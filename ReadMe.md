#CMPG 323 Project 2
This repo is for my API that I created using Visual Studios and Azure. I also use swagger for the display of the API.

#I divided the Project into 3 phases. 
Phase 1 was the design of my database in azure.
Phase 2 was the creation and setup of the API.
Phase 3 was the deployment of the API.

#How to access and use the API
A user can access the API through: https://connectedofficee.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html
A user in an ideal case would have needed to be registered to use the API but as I could not have gotten the authentication to work 
anybody can use the API without being registered. 

There are 4 different categories. Authenticate, Categories, Devices and Zones.
